    heading: BONJOUR
    textarea_html: >-
      <h2>Hello!<br />I'm Bianca</h2><p>I have been living in Costa Rica for 12
      years because of my love for nature and life in the ocean. Traveling was
      always second nature to me and has become my life's purpose. I started
      shooting real estate in 2018 in Costa Rica. This experience has helped me
      grow as a travel content creator. As a surfer, I started enjoying water
      photography and in 2022, I decided to take a freediving course and thats
      when I felt like I found my soul's purpose. I believe freediving and
      underwater photography is what sets me apart from most other content
      creators. I am very comfortable in water both infront and behind the
      camera. I was recently published as a storyteller at Ocean Culture Life
      and will continue pursuing underwater photography and conservation
      efforts.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Travel is a big part of my inspiration and what drives my creativity. I
      thrive in natural wild landscapes and enjoy being able to share these
      magical places with the world. Beyond its ability to evoke wanderlust and
      inspire wild explorations, travel photography is a catalyst for personal
      growth. It encourages us to step outside our comfort zones, to embrace the
      unknown, and to embrace the transformative power of travel. It becomes a
      vehicle for self-discovery, challenging us to see the world with fresh
      eyes and to uncover the hidden beauty in the most unexpected places.</p>

    heading: Real Estate
    textarea_html: >-
      <p>I became a photographer first by focusing on real estate photography.
      In the last 6 years, I have built multiple business providing high quality
      content for clients. Real estate photography is more than just pretty
      pictures of houses. It is a glimpse into the possibilities that lie within
      four walls, a catalyst for dreams, and a testament to the power of
      imagination. It is a visual tapestry that weaves together the hopes and
      aspirations of buyers and sellers, creating a symphony of possibilities
      that resonates with the human spirit. With real estate photography, we
      unlock the doors to a world where dreams come true, one photograph at a
      time.</p>

    heading: Underwater
    textarea_html: >-
      <p>My favorite and most fulfilling work is done under the surface.
      Underwater photography offers the advantages of exploring a hidden world,
      raising conservation awareness, capturing unique subjects, enabling
      artistic expression, experiencing adventure and exploration, fostering
      personal connections, and facilitating education and sharing. It is a
      medium of expression, a call to action, and a gateway to the
      extraordinary. Through the lens of underwater photography, we discover a
      world that is as diverse and vibrant as our wildest dreams, and we are
      forever changed by the depths we dare to explore.</p>

    textarea_html: >-
      <p>Aerial photography is more than just a way to capture pretty pictures
      from above. It is an invitation to embrace the extraordinary, to see the
      world through the eyes of a dreamer, and to unlock the limitless
      possibilities that lie beyond the horizon. It is a celebration of
      creativity, a testament to human ingenuity, and a reminder that when we
      rise above, we gain a broader perspective on life's most extraordinary
      tapestryâ€”the world itself.</p>
