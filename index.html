At the time, although I knew I wanted to be a voice for our planet, I didn't realise that photography would by my way of sharing these stories.&nbsp;</p><p>I moved to Costa Rica with desire to connect to the ocean and find myself. Throughout the years I learned about permaculture, and natural building and proudly pioneered two of the first natural eco home rentals in Costa Rica.I also started a campervan rental business in 2018 which simultaneously started my journey with social media and professional photography. Since then I have been a full time travel content creator with a passion for adventure with purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>\_</p>"

    textarea_html: >-
      <p>I have been living in Costa Rica for 12 years because of my love for
      nature and life in the ocean. Traveling was always second nature to me and
      has become my life's purpose. I started shooting real estate in 2018 in
      Costa Rica. This experience has helped me grow as a travel content
      creator. As a surfer, I started enjoying water photography and in 2022, I
      decided to take a freediving course and thats when I felt like I found my
      soul's purpose. I believe freediving and underwater photography is what
      sets me apart from most other content creators. I am very comfortable in
      water both infront and behind the camera. I was recently published as a
      storyteller at Ocean Culture Life and will continue pursuing underwater
      photography and conservation efforts.&nbsp;</p>
